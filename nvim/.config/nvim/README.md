# Neovim Configuration

This directory contains my personal **Neovim configuration**, managed as part of my [dotfiles](../../..).  
It is based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which served as a starting point for a minimal yet powerful setup. Over time, I adapt and extend it to match my own workflow.

## Features
- Fast startup with lazy-loading of plugins
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) integration
- Autocompletion and snippets
- Treesitter syntax highlighting and text objects
- Git integration
- Basic defaults for a productive development environment

## Structure
The configuration is located under `~/.config/nvim/` and is managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) like the rest of my dotfiles.
