# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal **dotfiles** for quickly setting up and managing my development environment on **Arch Linux**.  
Using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), configuration files can easily be versioned, synchronized, and deployed on new systems.  

## Included configurations
- **Hyprland** – dynamic tiling Wayland compositor  
- **Waybar** – customizable status bar for Wayland  
- **Kitty** – GPU-accelerated terminal  
- **wlogout** – graphical logout menu for Wayland
